# Barbecue-Project

The code I used to make a temperature sensing fan for my charcoal barbecue. 

The project uses an arduino, a small fan, a small display and a thermocouple to read, display and adjust the fan to on or off to supply the coals with more air. The desired temperature can be specified with an attached potentiometer.
